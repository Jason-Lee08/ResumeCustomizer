To view the user-data and job description that was passed into the customizer program that generated the resume above, please navigate to the following files:

- [ In Progress ] Create elegant website UI, enable users to sign-in using oAuth
- [ ] Modify Autogen configurations to use Groq API
      - Much cheaper than OpenAI API
